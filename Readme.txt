This repository contains a Python implementation of a Sudoku solver. The solver uses a backtracking algorithm to fill in the cells of the Sudoku grid, ensuring the solution adheres to the rules of Sudoku.

Features
Backtracking Algorithm: The core of the solver is a backtracking algorithm that tries to fill in cells one by one and backtracks when an invalid placement is detected.
User Input: Users can input their own Sudoku puzzles in a 9x9 grid format.
Output: The solution is displayed once the solver finds a valid solution.
Requirements
Python 3.x
No external libraries are required (pure Python implementation).
